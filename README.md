## About
StuHub is an all-in-one student management service that would allow students to access information such as their GPA, courses, advisors, professors and more. The website is built to cater to students in such a manner that they can view all the information they need in one area. The web application has two views; one for students to perform read access to their data and one for admins to perform Create Read Update and Delete(CRUD).
